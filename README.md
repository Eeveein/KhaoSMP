KhaoSMP: A Minecraft modpack!

# Install Guide 
## If installing for the first time:
- Step 1: If you haven't, download [Prism Launcher (recommended as this allows easier updates if AutoModpack fails)](https://prismlauncher.org/download/windows/) **or** the [CurseForge app (download the standalone option, trust me, overwolf suuucks)](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app)
- Step 2: Go to Releases and download the latest .zip release 
- Step 3 (Prism Launcher): On the top left, click "Add Instance", then go to the Import tab within the window that just opened and select the release zip you just downloaded.
- Step 3 (CurseForge): On the top left, click "Import" and select the release zip you just downloaded.
- Step 4: Wait for the modpack to install and enjoy!
## If updating from a previous version:
(In case AutoModpack wasn't in the version you were using or failed to work for you, AutoModpack was added as of 2.0)
(Only works with Prism Launcher, if using CurseForge you will have to install it anew using the above steps)
- Step 1: Go to Releases and download the latest .zip release
- Step 2: Right click your modpack instance in Prism, and click "Edit" in the context window.
- Step 3: On the left side, click on the "CurseForge" tab, and then "Update from file", then select the release zip you just downloaded.
- Step 4: Wait for the modpack to update and enjoy!
