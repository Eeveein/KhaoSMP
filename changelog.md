- Updated *most* mods (Basically all except for Create and it's addons as I'm still waiting for the addons to update to support Create 6.0.0, the hype is real!)
- Added Starbuncle Mania
This mod adds, well, a lot of stuff to starbuncles and general Ars Nouveau! The main stuff added is:
Source can be handled as a fluid and there are a few related features to liquid Source.
The "Fluid Sourcelink" has been added which allows generation of source from some fluids.
Some new Starbuncle accessories have been added which allow them to transport things such as power and fluids!
And more!
- Added More Compat: Wood Good and More Compat: Stone Zone
Adds all the variants of all the woods in all the shapes from other mods! And the stone :3 I think Ellie will like this addition.
- Added Quark (and some addons for compatibility)
Quark adds and changes a LOT of features, *most* of the features I've enabled for this modpack can be found here [link]
- Added Sophisticated Storage
It's like Sophisticated Backpacks mixed with both Storage Drawers and Iron Chests! You can upgrade chests, barrels and Shulker Boxes to better tiers, this gives them more storage and the ability to use Upgrades, these upgrades are mostly the same as Sophisticated Backpacks. You can also create Limited Barrels which work exactly like Storage Drawers, with these additions. (The Storage Tool works in place of Keys for these.)
- Some resource packs have been included in the modpack, they are enabled by default, but can be disabled if you wish.
- General fixes
- Removed some mods for various reasons.
- Removed Distant Horizons :( (Will look into potentially fixing and re-adding it in the future.)
