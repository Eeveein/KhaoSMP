## Automation
- Ender Watcher
Outputs a redstone signal if you look at it, the closer you look to the center, the stronger the redstone signal.
- Feeding Trough
Automatically feeds animals with inputted food, with the downside of the animals having a chance to need more than one item of food to breed and stopping breeding when there are more than 32 animals in a 10 block radius (But they will still eat from the trough, be careful!)
- Gravisand
Gravisand will not fall until powered by redstone, if the Gravisand has a block under it, it will instead fall upward. The signal will spread to all physically connected Gravisand blocks and Gravisand blocks output a comparator signal of 15.
- Metal Buttons
Adds two new types of button, Gold and Iron. Gold buttons emit a 2 tick long pulse and Iron buttons emit a 5 second long pulse.
- Obsidian Pressure Plate
Only activates when stepped on by a player.
- Pistons can move tile entities
- Redstone Randomizer
When given a redstone signal from the back it randomly emits a signal from the left or right side.
## Building
- Many new decorative blocks
I won't list them all so I don't bore you hahah.
- Colored and Glass item frames
Item Frames can now be colored like leather armor, and Glass Item Frames will disappear when an item is put inside, showing only the item and not the frame. Glass item frames can also attach to Signs and Storage Blocks (such as chests and barrels, allowing opening the inventory through them).
- Hollow Logs
Should come in all wood types thanks to Wood Good, these are just as their name says, but if vertical can also be climbed from the inside like a ladder.
- Iron Grate
Animals refuse to walk on Iron Grates and items will pass through them. They act as normal blocks for Players and Monsters. Leashed animals can also walk across the grates, making it very easy to trap animals in a pen.
- Vine Clipping
The ends of vines can be clipped using shears, this will prevent vines from growing. This also works on modded vines, but doesn't give them a new texture. (This was a feature before but Vines clipped after this update will have a new texture, but old clipped Vines will still not grow. They can be re-clipped.) 
## Client
- Buckets with animals inside will now properly show the animal inside. 
(Might not apply to modded mobs)
- Camera Mode
Pressing F12 (by default, rebindable) will open Camera Mode, alike other games this mode lets you easily take screenshots and apply filters. You can even enable grid lines such as the Rule of Thirds or the Golden Ratio to help you take a perfect image!
- The Pick Block keybind has a significantly increased range
Most useful for Creative, but don't forget that Pick Block can be used in survival as well, moving the block from anywhere within your inventory to your hand!
- Soul Candles
Candles placed on Soul Sand or Soul Soil will emit soul flames, alike fire when placed on the same blocks.
- Usage Ticker
Next to the hotbar, you will now see the amount of the item you're holding you have across your whole inventory. Useful for building!.
- Animals now have randomized textures
## Management
- General Inventory convenience additions
- Pressing Shift+(your chat key, T by default) while hovering over an item in any inventory will send that item in chat, letting people see the same info as you do when hovering over it. Always fun to share your items with silly names!
- Quick Armor Stand Swapping
Sneaking while interacting with an Armor Stand will swap your armor with it's armor.
## Mobs
- Foxhounds
The foxhounds are hostile mobs that spawn in the nether, typically in a fiery color scheme, but if found in a Soul Sand Valley they are blue. If you're brave, you can drink a fire resistance potion and feed them some Coal to tame them. Tamed foxhounds behave like Wolves but will also sleep on hot blocks like magma and if sitting atop a furnace, will make the furnace faster.
## Tools
- Ambience Discs
8 new discs that add a wide range of ambient sound to the game. When you insert them into a Jukebox, they loop infinitely, and do not display on the UI when played. These are aquired when a Skeleton kills a Spider.
- Slime Buckets
Interacting with a tiny slime using a bucket will put the slime in the bucket. It will start moving if you are within a Slime Chunk, making it the perfect Slime Chunk detector. You can also use it in place of slimeballs when crafting. You monster.
- Trowel
When used, it will place a random block from your hotbar. Yay for textured building!
## Tweaks
- Armor stands now have arms by default
- Campfires boost Elytra
When flying using an Elytra over a Campfire with a Hay Bale under it, the player will be propelled upwards slightly. Soul campfires will do the opposite, pulling you down.
- Compasses work everywhere
In the Nether, a compass will point to the portal you entered from, provided you had it on you when you did.
In the End, a compass will point to the overworld portal.
- Fan coral can be placed on top of cacti (and will stay alive)
- Double doors open together when right clicked.
- Ladder Tweaks
Right clicking a ladder with another one will place it at the bottom of the chain, ladders placed this way do not need a block behind them, as long as the top ladder has a block behind it. When on a ladder, looking down will make you slide down the ladder very quickly.
- Fortunate Gold Tools
Golden Tools always have the effect of Fortune 2 or Looting 2, this does not stack with enchantments and will be replaced by the effect of the enchantment.
- Glass Shards
When broken without silk touch, most types of glass will drop Glass Shards, acting the same as glowstone dust whereas you get more with fortune and can craft them in a 2x2 back into vanilla glass. If you mix different types of stained glass shards you get a new block, Dirty Glass.
- Hoe Harvesting
Breaking grass or crops with a hoe will break a 3x3 of them, Diamond and Netherite hoes will break a 5x5. This also applies to harvesting crops by interacting using the hoe. If the hoe has fortune, this applies to all blocks broken or harvested.
- If magma blocks are placed below Concrete Powder, they will not solidify when touched by water.
- Maps can be washed in a cauldron, turning them back into blank maps.
- Banners have a higher layer limit. (16)
- Pink Petals can be placed onto water similarly to lily pads.
- Pig Litters
Pigs will now have litters of children when bred. The amount can range from 2-3 but using Golden Carrots allows up to 5 pigs in one litter!
- Babies Forever
Feeding a baby animal a Poisonous Potato has a chance to poison it for a few seconds. A baby animal that has been poisoned by this method will never grow into an adult.
- Reacharound Placing
Reacharound Placing allows you to place blocks behind the one you're looking at. This can be done either vertically or horizontally. To do it vertically, sneak on the edge of a block and look at the area directly below it A [ ] will appear around your crosshair if you do it properly. To do it horizontally, look in front of a block,  A < > will appear around your crosshair for this one.
- Creature Fall Damage
Slimes take no fall damage and Rabbits can drop 5 more blocks than usual without taking damage.
- Snow Golem Player Heads
If a snow golem is named the same thing as any other player and is wearing a pumpkin, it will drop the head of that player if killed by a witch.
- Sponges can be placed directly on water
- Horses can swim
- New handy recipes
- Vexes die when their summoning Evoker dies. Good riddance!
- Villagers will follow you when holding emerald blocks like animals do when holding food.
## World
(The actual worldgen changes will obviously only apply to new chunks.)
- Ashen Wood
A new tree type which comes in a light gray! They can only be obtained through a Sniffer digging them up. These also drop a new fruit, the Enchanted Fruit.
- Azalea Wood
Azalea trees now grow with a new wood type, which you can craft into pretty light green wood!
- Chorus Vegetation
In the End you will sometimes be able to find patches of Chorus Weeds and Chorus Twist. These are neat decorations to the ground, but also have some "ender" properties.
Occasionally, they will teleport to a random location around them, having a tiny chance to reproduce while doing so. When trampled by a non-ender living being they will always teleport, with a small chance to spawn an endermite (making grinding for them way less painful).
Bone Meal will force the block to teleport with a guranteed chance of reproducing itself.
- Crystalline Corundums
These come in all vanilla dye colors and will spawn in clusters in the Stone layer underground. These come in both blocks and Amethyst-like clusters and provide very pretty decoration. They can be crafted into a few building blocks. 
If placed deep underground, will slowly grow up to 4 blocks tall. When they're in a place they can grow, they will emit particles. The growth and particles can be prevented by waxing them using honeycomb, and the wax can be removed with an axe.
- Corundum Lamps
Great decorative lamps, and will also color beacon beams passing through them like Stained Glass, but only when powered by redstone.
- Beacon Redirection
Corundum Clusters will redirect a beacon beam to the direction it's facing, and will also change the color. The beacon beam must always end facing upwards to work. Tinted glass can also be used to dim the beacon beam.
- Runic Etching
A rare new smithing template found in dungeons, temples and nether fortresses. These can be duplicated using corundum and cobblestone. Using a smithing table, you can apply this on any tool (not only armor!) with a (vanilla) dye of choice to recolor the enchantment glint. You can also apply it without a dye to remove the enchantment glint (while keeping the enchantments) or with Blaze Powder to make the glint rainbow colored!
- Fairy Rings and Fallen Trees
In forests, you'll occasionally find rings of flowers, if you dig far down at the center you'll find emeralds or diamonds! You can also find Fallen Trees which will be hollow and covered in foliage.
- Glimmering Weald
Under Y=0 you can find a new underground biome, filled with unique, bioluminescent fungal vegetation. You'll find more Lapis and Glow Squids in this biome as well.
- New Stone Types
Four new types of stone can spawn in the world, Shale, Limestone, Jasper, and most unique, Myalite. 
The first three act as regular stone clusters, but Myalite spawns in the End and will slightly change its tint depending on where it's placed. 
In the End you will also find "Spiral Spikes", huge stalagmites of Obsidian with a spiral of Myalite Crystals erupting from the top, another decorative block. They can be grown alike Corundums if placed below any Corundum that can grow, replacing the Corundum.
Myalite Crystals can also be used to create Myalite Viaducts, a way to redirect Ender Pearl teleportation. These can be arranged like pipes with up to 24 blocks length, and when an ender pearl is thrown onto one end, the player will teleport to the other. On a fork, the destination is randomly chosen, and any loops will simply leave the player at the start as if they threw the Ender Pearl at a normal block.
- Trumpet Trees
Uncommonly, you'll find the occasional Trumpet Tree, these come in 6 variants, all having the same wood but different pretty colorful leaves. They also come with a new red wood type, Trumpet Wood.
